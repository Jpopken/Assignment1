# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Finder

## Project Description

This program is a tiny group programming assignment for the Software Engineering course. The objective of the assignment is to write a program that helps an interactive user search for "near misses" of Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that there are no natural numbers x, y, and z such that xn + yn = zn for n > 2. The program systematically searches for x, y, and z combinations that are "almost right" and displays the smallest relative miss found.


## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository.
3. Run the executable file ([main]).
4. Follow the prompts to input the value of n and k.
5. Review the output to see the near misses found.
